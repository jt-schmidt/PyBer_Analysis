## Overview
For this challenge, task was to utilize MatPlotLib with Python to explore various charting & formatting options available to perform intrisic data visualization.

Specific dataset used was a simulation of ride sharing data:
-- Ride data (2376 rows)
-- City data (121 rows)

Using the visualizations within the module & challenge assignment, goal is to determine what relationships (specifically by city type) can be discerned within the datasets.

<!---
Results:  There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

## Results

Key charts from module & challenge assignment to determine pattern by city types: 
-- Rural
-- Suburban
-- Urban
